# BetterFiends
BetterFiends is a mod for Schedule I to improve on the fiending behavior already present in the game (and rarely used). This mod will give a chance to each NPC, when consuming one of your products, to become a fiend based on their addiction level and the addictiveness of the product. Along with that, they will only fiend for the product that they consumed at the time (the name of the product is in the request the give you). If you deny the request or give them the wrong product, they will attack you. There is also a slim chance that they will become a "narc" and call the cops on you.

#Change log
## 1.1.0
### Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue where product names had "(... unpackaged)", it will now just say the product name.
